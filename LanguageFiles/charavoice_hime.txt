<0001> Please be good...
<0002> How's this?
<0003> There!
<0004> O-hoho.
<0005> I'll use this.
<0006> How will this go?
<0007> Here I go...
<0008> This should be good.
<0009> O-hoho... this could be fun.
<0010> Okay, I'll put down a trap.
<0011> It's dangerous here, okay?
<0012> Lend me your power.
<0013> How about this?
<0014> O-hoho, here I go.
<0015> O-hoho, this is fun.
<0016> Be wrapped in my chains.
<0017> *Yawn*... that was a good nap.
<0018> Oh, it's morning already?
<0019> Now's a good time.
<0020> I may have been a little too leisurely.
<0021> I'll rest a little more.
<0022> Haa...
<0023> Still resting.
<0024> Oh, no good.
<0025> Take that.
<0026> Okay.
<0027> O-hohohoho.
<0028> It's like this.
<0029> Oh.
<0030> Oww.
<0031> Oh my.
<0032> Enough.
<0033> What a nice wind.
<0034> That feels good.
<0035> So warm.
<0036> How soothing.
<0037> Oh my?
<0038> Where am I going?
<0039> Please take me somewhere wonderful.
<0040> Boing.
<0041> Zzzz....
<0042> Hah, time to rest.
<0043> Good night.
<0044> Shall we take it easy?
<0045> Now then, shall we dance?
<0046> Shall we play?
<0047> O-hoho, let's have some fun.
<0048> Now then, I'll start.
<0049> Oh, an invitation?
<0050> Please allow me some fun.
<0051> I'll face you.
<0052> You're rather energetic.
<0053> Take that!
<0054> Sorry if this hurts.
<0055> It's like this.
<0056> Haah.
<0057> Geez.
<0058> Kyaa...
<0059> Oh.
<0060> Ngh.
<0061> Oooh.
<0062> How surprising.
<0063> You're strong.
<0064> Ooooooooh?
<0065> Simple.
<0066> That was close.
<0067> O-hoho, I'm over here.
<0068> Yes, that was good.
<0069> That was fun.
<0070> Let's play again sometime.
<0071> That wasn't enough dancing.
<0072> It's over already?
<0073> O-hoho, you're quite lively.
<0074> I'm a bit exhausted...
<0075> I'm going to rest.
<0076> Time for a bit of a break...
<0077> Oh, so shiny.
<0078> Lovely.
<0079> O-hoho, so many of them.
<0080> Stars... they're lovely.
<0081> My stars...
<0082> I dropped some stars.
<0083> My stars got scattered around...
<0084> Oh... my stars...
<0085> A trap...?
<0086> It's a trap...
<0087> I fell for a trap...
<0088> Geez, what a terrible thing to do.
<0089> Seems strong.
<0090> Oh, there's something here.
<0091> O-hoho, seems this could get more enjoyable.
<0092> Oh my, this could get difficult.
<0093> I want stars.
<0094> I like shiny things.
<0095> I'll collect stars.
<0096> I want to collect a lot of stars.
<0097> O-hoho, let's dance the day away.
<0098> I want to play a lot.
<0099> I want to dance with various people.
<0100> I'd like to make merry sometimes as well.
<0101> You're okay with me?
<0102> O-hoho, looking forward to working with you.
<0103> Yes, let's dance together.
<0104> Thank you for the invitation.
<0105> Now then, shall we enjoy ourselves?
<0106> Everyone seems full of energy.
<0107> O-hoho...
<0108> Now, let's begin.
<0109> That was incredibly fun.
<0110> I'm number one...?
<0111> O-hoho, let's play again.
<0112> Oh, I wanted to play some more...
<0113> I found something nice.
<0114> This is wonderful, isn't it?
<0115> Is this what you want?
<0116> Oh, how wonderful.
<0117> Nice.
<0118> How nice.
<0119> Yes.
<0120> No.
<0121> Wow...
<0122> I'm so happy.
<0123> Hmm...
<0124> Shall we go?
<0125> I throw these, huh?
<0126> Let's go.
<0127> Greetings.
<0128> What should I do...?
<0129> How wonderful.
<0130> Amazing.
<0131> Oh my.
<0132> I'm borrowing this...
<0133> I wonder what this does.
<0134> I'm borrowing this for a bit.
<0135> So this is that person's power.
<0136> You have my thanks.
<0137> Well, Suguri, shall we dance?
<0138> O-hoho, to think Suguri would invite me.
<0139> O-hoho, that was a lot of fun, Suguri.
<0140> Hah, playing with you really is fun, Suguri.
<0141> Let's play together, Sis.
<0142> Dancing with Sis sounds fun.
<0143> Sis really is wonderful.
<0144> Your beam is a bit hot, Sis...
<0145> Oh, you're the spitting image of that good-for-nothing.
<0146> Hold on... I don't like you.
<0147> Beating you up is somewhat enjoyable.
<0148> You really are a good-for-nothing...
<0149> No more violence, okay?
<0150> You're so useless...
<0151> Settle down.
<0152> Seriously... you're truly useless.
<0153> Oh, that's a cute, red airplane.
<0154> Okay, let's begin. In order to protect everyone...
<0155> Everyone, things are about to get tough.
<0156> O-hoho, those clothes really do suit you.
<0157> You're wearing the clothes I picked out for you.
<0158> O-hoho, you've shown me something nice.
<0159> You're strong even when you're wearing cute clothes, Suguri.
<0160> Fufu, you look really adorable in that.
<0161> How do I look? Do I look good in this?
<0162> You want to play with me again? Fufu, sure, gladly.
