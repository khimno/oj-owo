<0000> Alright.
<0001> Here!
<0002> Roll around...
<0003> Hey!
<0004> I think I'll use this.
<0005> I guess I'll do this.
<0006> I'll pick this.
<0007> I choose this.
<0008> Trap set.
<0009> Okay.
<0010> It's a trap.
<0011> Maybe like this?
<0012> I'm using this.
<0013> I can't lose this game.
<0014> I'll do this.
<0015> This!
<0016> Accelerator!
<0017> Phew...
<0018> Alright, I can move again.
<0019> Okay then, I'll go again.
<0020> This is where it begins.
<0021> Huh? This wasn't supposed to happen...
<0022> Ugh.
<0023> What?
<0024> Oh no.
<0025> Let's do this.
<0026> Yah!
<0027> Hah!
<0028> There!
<0029> Ugh.
<0030> Augh.
<0031> Wah.
<0032> Wawah.
<0033> Pheeew...
<0034> I'm feeling warm.
<0035> I've recovered.
<0036> Feels good.
<0037> I'm getting blown away.
<0038> Where am I going?
<0039> I'm flying.
<0040> Warping.
<0041> Aaaaugh.
<0042> I need to rest a little bit...
<0043> Ugh, I messed up.
<0044> *Sigh*...
<0045> It's time to fight.
<0046> If you stand in my way...
<0047> I'm coming for you.
<0048> We're fighting.
<0049> Are you hoping for a battle?
<0050> Sure, bring it on.
<0051> I'm not losing.
<0052> You want to fight me?
<0053> Hah!
<0054> I'll get you!
<0055> Yah!
<0056> Tah!
<0057> Ugh.
<0058> Uuu.
<0059> Augh.
<0060> Guhh.
<0061> Hmm...
<0062> Uwaah.
<0063> Hey now.
<0064> Aaargh.
<0065> Can't touch this.
<0066> I dodged it.
<0067> That was close.
<0068> Whoa.
<0069> Phew, I made it.
<0070> I'm okay.
<0071> Looks like I won.
<0072> I did my best.
<0073> Hmm...
<0074> Hauu.
<0075> You're strong.
<0076> You're amazing.
<0077> They're shining.
<0078> I'm glad.
<0079> Well done.
<0080> So many of them...
<0081> No, my stars...
<0082> Uh...
<0083> My stars...
<0084> Mhmm...
<0085> A trap?!
<0086> I never noticed that...
<0087> Ugh, shoot.
<0088> Isn't this...
<0089> A big one appeared...
<0090> Danger approaches...
<0091> I'd better be cautious.
<0092> A strong one came out.
<0093> I'm gathering stars.
<0094> I choose stars.
<0095> I'll get a lot of stars.
<0096> Stars...
<0097> I guess I'll pick battles.
<0098> I'll go get wins.
<0099> I choose to fight.
<0100> Alright, I'll win.
<0101> Okay, good to play with you.
<0102> You can count on me.
<0103> Let's do our best.
<0104> Alright then.
<0105> I'll go all out.
<0106> Let's get going.
<0107> It began.
<0108> What should I do?
<0109> Well played.
<0110> We managed to get through this.
<0111> Hehheh, I did a good job, didn't I?
<0112> We won!
<0113> We've got something new.
<0114> It's a new item.
<0115> Haven't seen that before.
<0116> Did you get something good?
<0117> Okay.
<0118> That's good.
<0119> Yeah.
<0120> No.
<0121> Mhmm...
<0122> Good job.
<0123> Huh?
<0124> Okay, let's go.
<0125> Be a good roll.
<0126> Let's do this.
<0127> Hi.
<0128> Hmm.
<0129> Great.
<0130> That is amazing.
<0131> Ugh...
<0132> Let me borrow this for a bit.
<0133> Can I use this?
<0134> This isn't my own power, but...
<0135> I'll try this one...!
<0136> Let's play, Hime.
<0137> It's a little child...
<0138> Here I come, Sora.
<0139> I'm dashing through!
<0140> The god of... Pudding...
<0141> Star Breaker... I'm stopping you.
<0142> Wow, that is one big castle...
<0143> I won't let you do whatever you please.
<0144> Is that another me...?
<0145> "The past me"...? What do you mean?
<0146> This is a complicated feeling...
<0147> Are you really me?
<0148> Sure, I'm in.
<0149> You got carried away, Hime.
<0150> Yeah, I had fun, too.
<0151> I know you're not easy to beat, Sora.
<0152> Fufu, that was fun, Sora.
<0153> I'm impressed how strong you still are.
