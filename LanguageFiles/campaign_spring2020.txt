// ========= Scene: Spring 2020 Event Start =========

// (No Speaker)
<0000> After starting to travel together, Ellie and Lulu arrive at a town.

// (ellie)
<0001> A-a-ahaaa! Ohmigawd, ohmigawd! We're in the biggest trouble ever, Lulu!

// (lulu)
<0002> What's the problem, Ellie?

// (ellie)
<0003> We're all out of travel money...

// (lulu)
<0004> Out of what?

// (ellie)
<0005> Travel money! We can't stay at an inn or get food without it!

// (lulu)
<0006> We can't get food?! T-this is a crisis!

// (ellie)
<0007> Ugh, I've got no choice but to string along some suckers for cash!

// (lulu)
<0008> You sure you can do that?

// (ellie)
<0009> It's gonna be fine. I'm such a super cute girl, I bet I can make enough money to buy a country in a day...!

// (lulu)
<0010> A doghouse would be the best you could get.

// (ellie)
<0011> Huh? Did you just insult me?

// (lulu)
<0012> No way.

// (ellie)
<0013> Hmm, but seriously, what should we do? Not being able to get food means not being able to maintain my stunning bodyyy.

// (lulu)
<0014> Hey, Ellie, what are those papers over there about?

// (ellie)
<0015> Huh? They're...

// (ellie)
<0016> Monster hunting quests...!

// (ellie)
<0017> Okay, alright... I can beat all these monsters up real easy!

// (lulu)
<0018> What will happen if you beat them?

// (ellie)
<0019> You'll get rewarded with money!

// (lulu)
<0020> So that means...

// (ellie)
<0021> We can get a fancy dinner and sleep in comfy beds tonight!

// (ellieandlulu)
<0022> Ahaaa!"

// (ellie)
<0023> Alright, Lulu, we'll go hunt some monsters right now!

// (lulu)
<0024> Yeah!

// ========= Scene: Spring 2020 Event Ending =========

// (ellie)
<0025> Behold! This is the bounty we earned! Ahaaa!

// (lulu)
<0026> Whoaaa, that's amazing, Ellie! With that, we'll be able to afford food for a while, won't we?

// (ellie)
<0027> Definitely. I mean, I even got enough to party a bit... Ku-fu-fu.

// (lulu)
<0028> Wah, you look like you're thinking of something wicked.

// (ellie)
<0029> Oh right, I've got to reward you for all your hard work out there, too.

// (lulu)
<0030> Yeah, Lulu worked real hard, too!

// (ellie)
<0031> Anything you want?

// (lulu)
<0032> Hmm... Lulu wants some good food, and that's it.

// (ellie)
<0033> Ahaaa!♥ Of course, I'm going to get you good food!

// (ellie)
<0034> But I want to get you something else as a gift.

// (lulu)
<0035> A gift? Hmm, what Lulu wants is...

// (lulu)
<0036> She can't think of anything.

// (ellie)
<0037> You've got no dreams, Lulu!

// (ellie)
<0038> If you really have no idea what you want, I'll choose for you.

// (lulu)
<0039> Ah, Lulu likes the sound of that! She wants you to choose for her!

// (ellie)
<0040> Alright, I got this! With my most excellent taste in gifting, I'll get you the best gift you ever got.

// (ellie)
<0041> Now, ta-da!

// (lulu)
<0042> Howah. Is that a... strip of cloth?

// (ellie)
<0043> This goes around your big tail like this and...

// (ellie)
<0044> Done!

// (lulu)
<0045> Wow, it's a ribbon!

// (ellie)
<0046> Ahaaa♥ You look super cute with it on!

// (lulu)
<0047> That's quite a normal gift from someone with the most excellent taste, but yeah, it sure is cute.

// (ellie)
<0048> Wait, did you just insult my tas-

// (lulu)
<0049> Lulu loves it. Thanks so much, Ellie!

// (ellie)
<0050> Ahaaa, you're welcome! There's a whole lot more, though!

// (ellie)
<0051> Look, Lulu, we still have this much money left. Let's go party! Party!

// (lulu)
<0052> Whoa, Ellie, wait up!

// (ellie)
<0053> Ahaaa♥
