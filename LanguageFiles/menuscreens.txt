< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_06 >
Build your co-op deck freely using the new Deck Point system! More powerful cards cost more Deck Points to bring with you. Remember that all cards are used by you and your allies.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_07 >
Note that many characters' Hyper cards work differently in co-op! You can toggle between regular and co-op cards in the Binder to look at the effects in detail.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_08 >
Your Deck Point pool is determined by your character rating. A-ranked characters are considered most fitting for that role, and start with 10 Deck Points. 

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_09 >
Characters with a lower rating for each role have more Deck Points to compensate. Experiment with different character/role combinations!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SPRING2019_INSTRUCTION_10 >
Bosses move on the field and can attack you! They only activate movement-related panels (Move, Warp etc.) Always keep their location in mind for your tactics.

Each fish has their own weight and speed. Catch fast or big fish to gain more score!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_06 >
The minigame may speed up randomly. This includes both fish speed and your own hook speed.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_07 >
All players are ranked by their fish score at the end of the fishing phase. Players will be rewarded with Wins based on their ranking and stars based on score.

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_08 >
Pay attention to the grill! It always has a set of 3 fish to catch, and catching them all scores an extra 15 points!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_09 >
Everyone has their own grill to fill, so try to complete more sets than your opponents within the time limit!

< PLAYMENU_EVENT_SUMMER2020_INSTRUCTION_10 >
Furthermore, catching the same fish type several times in a row will give extra Combo points toward your score.
