// ========= Scene: Summer 2021 Event Start =========

<9999> This is a story of a summer dream that may or may not have happened.

// (tomomo)
<0000> "Man, nothing better than ice-cold orange juice on a hot summer day!"

// (yuki)
<0001> "I know, right? I dig it, too."

// (tomomo)
<0002> "Well, I like hanging out in an air-conditioned room like this, but I kind of want to go to the beach before the summer is over."

// (tomomo)
<0003> "I mean, I would if I could swim..."

// (yuki)
<0004> "Huh? You can't swim? Want me to teach you?"

// (tomomo)
<0005> "What? You can swim? I thought cats couldn't."

// (yuki)
<0006> "I'm no ordinary cat. There's pretty much nothing a cat like me can't do."

// (tomomo)
<0007> "Teach me! Make me able to swim!"

// (yuki)
<0008> "Sure, but you'll owe me an otoro sushi dinner."

// (tomomo)
<0009> "Otoro is super expensive! B-but I've got no choice... Fine, whatever you say!"

// (yuki)
<0010> "Okay, it's a deal."

// (yuki)
<0011> "Alright, why don't we go to the nearby public swimming pool for now?"

// (mio)
<0012> "Hehehe, my sweet angel is going to the pool, huh."

// (tomomo&yuki)
<0013> "We're at the pool!"

// (yuki)
<0014> "Wait, what's with that big-ass swim ring?"

// (tomomo)
<0015> "Well, I'm too afraid to get into the water without it!"

// (yuki)
<0016> "What are you, a five-year-old?"

// (tomomo)
<0017> "Shut up! I need it, no matter what you say!"

// (yuki)
<0018> "*Sigh* Oh well, I guess we should start off by getting you used to the water, then."

// (tomomo)
<0019> "Oh, look, isn't that Kai over there?"

// (yuki)
<0020> "Oh, yeah. Looks like he's on his own."

// (tomomo)
<0021> "Hehehe, what a sad boy. I'm sure he'll be pleased if a kind and cute girl like me says hi to him."

// (tomomo)
<0022> "Hey, Kaaai!"

// (kai)
<0023> "Huh? Oh, it's just you guys."

// (tomomo)
<0024> "Didn't your mom teach you how to greet people? Anyway, you want to join us? I'm just going to practice swimming, though."

// (kai)
<0025> "I'm having fun swimming by myself here. Leave me alone."

// (yuki)
<0026> "Tomomo, stop wasting time on that jerk. We should go someplace else and get started."

// (mio)
<0027> "Tomomooo♥"

// (tomomo)
<0028> "Oh my god, Mio!? What the heck are you here for?"

// (mio)
<0029> "To play with you, of course♥ What else?"

// (tomomo)
<0030> "I'm here to learn how to swim! Not to play!"

// (mio)
<0031> "Then, let mama help you with that. There!"

// (tomomo)
<0032> "Stop saying you're my mama! Huh, what the, my swim ring...!"

// (yuki)
<0033> "Other people's swim rings and beach balls are rising into the air, too... and they're combining into one!"

// (mio)
<0034> "Ta-da. You can practice as much as you want with this big boy here."

// (tomomo)
<0035> "You idiot! Give my swim ring back! I can't get into the water without it!"

// (tomomo)
<0036> "I mean, another gigantic monster? Can't you do something better than those!"

// (mio)
<0037> "Such hurtful words. Well, maybe you'll get your stuff back if you beat him."

// (tomomo)
<0038> "Dang it! Fine, I'll get it back no matter what it takes! Yuki, Kai, you guys help me!"

// (yuki)
<0039> "This is going to be fun."

// (kai)
<0040> "Huh? Why me?"

// (tomomo)
<0041> "Just shut up and help me!"

// (kai)
<0042> "Yes, ma'am..."

// (mio)
<0043> "Good luck♥"

// ========= Scene: Summer 2021 Event Ending =========

// (tomomo)
<0044> "Alright! We beat the monster! And I got my swim ring back!"

// (yuki)
<0045> "He wasn't as strong as he looked."

// (kai)
<0046> "What did I do to deserve this..."

// (mio)
<0047> "How was it, Tomomo? Did you have fun?"

// (tomomo)
<0048> "No way! I could've learned how to swim by now if it weren't for you!"

// (yuki)
<0049> "Didn't you realize, Tomomo?"

// (kai)
<0050> "You were swimming when we were fighting that monster."

// (tomomo)
<0051> "Really?! I was way too focused to notice..."

// (mio)
<0052> "I told you I'd help you♥"

// (tomomo)
<0053> "Mio, you actually are a goo-..."

// (mio)
<0054> "That said, you don't need that swim ring anymore, right?"

// (tomomo)
<0055> "Huh, I guess not..."

// (mio)
<0056> "To celebrate your growth, I'll create a stronger monster for you to swim with!"

// (tomomo)
<0057> "What, wait, what?"

// (kai)
<0058> "What the heck is she saying...?"

// (yuki)
<0059> "I didn't see that coming. That girl never gets boring."

// (mio)
<0060> "And it's done. Now you can swim with him to your heart's content, Tomomo♥"

// (tomomo)
<0061> "That's why no one wants to be friends with you!"
