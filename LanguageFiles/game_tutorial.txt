Welcome to 100% Orange Juice! We will explain a few basics - if you wish, you can just skip over them.

< TUTORIAL_01 >
This is a 4-player board game where the usual goal is to reach "Norma" level 6 to win.

< TUTORIAL_02 >
You roll dice to move on a game board - different colored panels have different effects.

< TUTORIAL_03 >
This is a home panel. You always start in one, and must land on one to level up or to win the game.

< TUTORIAL_04 >
Each player has their own, numbered home and you can choose to stop there. You can visit any player's home with an exact roll, though.

< TUTORIAL_05 >
Your first objective is to gather 10 stars to level up, and then land on a home. After that you can choose whether to collect stars or fight battles to get more Wins for your next level-up.

< TUTORIAL_06 >
By the way, we recommend aiming for a star norma if you're unsure which to choose. You receive more stars every chapter, so you will never get stuck.

< TUTORIAL_07 >
Yellow panels are Bonus panels, and let you roll to gain stars. You will receive your current Level x rolled number stars (up to a multiplier of 3).

< TUTORIAL_08 >
Blue panels are Drop panels, and you will lose stars if you land on one. You will lose your current Level x rolled number stars (up to a multiplier of 5).

< TUTORIAL_09 >
Green is a Draw panel, and lets you draw a card.

< TUTORIAL_10 >
Red is an Encounter panel, and you will be forced to fight a wild enemy. If you win, you will receive Wins and stars.

< TUTORIAL_11 >
Purple is a Warp panel - it will take you to another random warp panel that has an exit.

< TUTORIAL_12 >
There are other, more advanced panels too... you will learn how they work as you play!

< TUTORIAL_13 >
If you run into another unit while moving, you get the opportunity to challenge them into a battle!

< TUTORIAL_14 >
You can hover over the unit portrait in the corner of the field to see the abilities of other units. They affect how good they are in battle.

< TUTORIAL_15 >
In battle, the attacker first rolls for damage, and if they have any +Attack bonus it's added to the roll.

< TUTORIAL_16 >
The defender can choose to Defend, which will lower the damage they take according to their roll, down to 1.

< TUTORIAL_17 >
If you choose Evade, the defender must roll higher than the attack roll to take no damage at all. Otherwise they take full damage.

< TUTORIAL_18 >
After surviving the first attack, the defender then gets a chance to attack back!

< TUTORIAL_19 >
If one of the players goes down to 0 HP, they suffer KO and the winner receives 50% of their held stars, and gains 2 Wins!

< TUTORIAL_20 >
Next, let's talk about cards! Each player chooses 10 cards to bring to the game, and they are shuffled together into the Center Deck, alongside 8 blank Hyper Cards.

< TUTORIAL_21 >
You should aim to bring cards that will help your chosen unit more than they will help your enemies.

< TUTORIAL_22 >
Each unit has a unique Hyper Card. If you draw a blank Hyper Card from the deck, it will turn into your unit's own Hyper Card. They usually have game-changingly powerful effects!

< TUTORIAL_23 >
Note that each card has a level from 1 to 5, marked on the left. You need to level up to the matching level to use the card. Most of them also cost stars to use (marked on the right).

< TUTORIAL_24 >
Many fields have 'Field Effects', which activate at certain intervals. You can hover over the 'Info' button to see field events and more.

< TUTORIAL_25 >
For example, the 'Charity' Field Effect lets each player draw a card from the Center Deck every 5 chapters.

< TUTORIAL_26 >
Once the first player reaches Norma level 4 in Versus mode, a powerful Boss will appear on the field, replacing all Encounter panels with Boss panels. Be careful to avoid fighting it!

< TUTORIAL_27 >
After each match you will receive some Stars as a reward, which you can use to purchase new cards and more in the Shop.

< TUTORIAL_28 >
When playing online or in Co-op mode, you will also receive Oranges which can be used to unlock various kinds of cosmetics in the Shop.

< TUTORIAL_29 >
If there is currently an event active, you can find more details on it by clicking the event banner in the main menu.

< TUTORIAL_30 >
Please enjoy the game... and beware of Marie Poppo!
