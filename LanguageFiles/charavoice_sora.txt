<0000> I'm throwing the dice.
<0001> Is it like this?
<0002> What will I get?
<0003> Give me... a good number.
<0004> I'm going to use this.
<0005> I'll use this to turn the tables.
<0006> Card...
<0007> With the power of this card...
<0008> I'm going to set a trap.
<0009> A trap's been placed.
<0010> Watch out for this panel here.
<0011> Trap.
<0012> I'll use a bit of power.
<0013> A battle card.
<0014> A slightly hot beam...
<0015> I'm powering myself up.
<0016> I'll use everything I have...!
<0017> I'm better now.
<0018> I can go on.
<0019> I'm not defeated yet.
<0020> I feel alive again.
<0021> Au...
<0022> I failed...
<0023> Fuaah...
<0024> Not quite there yet...
<0025> I'm attacking.
<0026> Yah!
<0027> Toh!
<0028> Tah!
<0029> Mh...
<0030> Mha...
<0031> Fua...
<0032> Ugh...
<0033> It's healing my cuts and bruises...
<0034> It's so warm...
<0035> I'm getting better.
<0036> I'm healed enough to keep fighting.
<0037> Fue?
<0038> Wah!
<0039> Where am I getting to?
<0040> Am I warping...?
<0041> I need to take a rest.
<0042> I'm drained.
<0043> Hau...
<0044> I'll just...
<0045> My apologies.
<0046> I'm ready to fight.
<0047> I'll do my best.
<0048> Battle...
<0049> I won't lose.
<0050> Are you going to come at me?
<0051> I'd like you to make way for me.
<0052> If we must fight, defeat is not an option.
<0053> Ey!
<0054> Hah!
<0055> Yah!
<0056> Eey!
<0057> Mh...
<0058> Fua...
<0059> Au...
<0060> Ow...
<0061> Wawawah!
<0062> That really hurts...
<0063> Wah, I'm in big trouble!
<0064> Muaah!
<0065> That won't reach me.
<0066> I'm dodging it.
<0067> I'm evading it.
<0068> I'm right here.
<0069> Phew... I won.
<0070> I did it.
<0071> Phew.
<0072> I managed to settle it.
<0073> Nuu...
<0074> Muu...
<0075> Uuu...
<0076> Aaa...
<0077> Stars...
<0078> More stars...
<0079> I'm happy.
<0080> I've got a lot.
<0081> My stars...
<0082> I feel down...
<0083> Oh no...
<0084> Stars... Where did they go...
<0085> I see it's a trap.
<0086> Is this a trap?
<0087> Rats.
<0088> Boy, I fell for it.
<0089> Something came out.
<0090> We'd better stay alert.
<0091> I sense something large.
<0092> That looks a little strong.
<0093> Stars...
<0094> Stars...
<0095> I'm going to gather stars.
<0096> Stars are pretty... I like them.
<0097> I'm going to win.
<0098> I'm going to fight.
<0099> I'll beat whoever stands in my way.
<0100> So, this Norma is about winning battles?
<0101> Me?
<0102> I hope we'll have a good game together.
<0103> I see it's time to work.
<0104> I will go all out...!
<0105> I'll begin my operation.
<0106> Watch me give it my everything.
<0107> I will go out there... to win.
<0108> Even in games, I won't settle for second best.
<0109> I won the game.
<0110> I did all I could.
<0111> My job here is done.
<0112> I won... I'm glad.
<0113> I'm glad.
<0114> We seem to have gotten a good thing.
<0115> Oh my... That is great.
<0116> What do you make of this?
<0117> Understood.
<0118> I think that is a good idea.
<0119> Yes.
<0120> I don't think so.
<0121> Hau...
<0122> Fufu.
<0123> Mhm...
<0124> It's time to go.
<0125> I'm going to roll... the dice.
<0126> Let's go.
<0127> Hello.
<0128> Muaah...
<0129> That is good.
<0130> That is amazing.
<0131> Oh...?
<0132> I'm going to borrow this one.
<0133> Let me play this card, please.
<0134> No idea what this does, but I'll do it anyway.
<0135> I hope I'm using this correctly.
<0136> I'll commence... my operation now!
<0137> Suguri... Why don't we play?
<0138> Suguri... Do you want to play with me?
<0139> Fufu, I beat Suguri.
<0140> You're as strong as ever.
<0141> Hime, do you want to dance?
<0142> Hime, I have some time for you.
<0143> Fufu, it was fun.
<0144> You're a good fighter, too.
<0145> Sham, here I come.
<0146> Idol... How very shiny...
<0147> I-I will never sing or dance like you...
<0148> D-do I have to dance like you...?
<0149> Star... Breaker...
<0150> I'm not losing to you!
<0151> No more making a ruckus, okay?
<0152> Please stop causing trouble...
<0153> Shield!
<0154> Shield, invert!
<0155> Unlimited charge...!
<0156> Mikky Mou-...!
