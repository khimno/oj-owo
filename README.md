# oj-owo translator
owo translator for 100% Orange Juice!

inspired by a user in the fbf community discord

Code is based on a very outdated version of the Google Translate mod code.

## Adaptation of scripts
You can easily adapt the scripts in this repo to suit your own need.

Simply replace the contents of the ``translateLoop`` function with your own code.

For example, the same code (minus several bugfixes) was used to create the 100% Google Translate mod by replacing the function with api calls to Google's Cloud Translate service.

## TODO
* Improve this readme with better docs
