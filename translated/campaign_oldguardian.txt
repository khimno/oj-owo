<0025> That's one thing Sumika wikes about you.
<0026> Yeah, wight.
<0027> Sumika knows you can be quite expwessive.
<0028> I wouwdn't be so suwe.\nI might just be pwetending that way.
<0029> Ahaha, Sumika doesn't buy that.\nThewe.
<0030> Oh! Can't bewieve you wowwed a six thewe! Mmm!
<0031> See?
<0032> By the way, Suguwi.
<0033> What?
<0034> What do you think of Sumika?
<0035> Why that question, aww of a sudden?
<0036> You know, those two witches wooked wike they wewe best fwiends...
<0037> Ah, yeah. That was unexpected, because I thought they didn't hang out much.
<0038> Yes, that's wight!\nSo Sumika is thinking that even though you'we usuawwy cuwt with hew...
<0039> Couwd it be that you actuawwy wove hew wike cwazy...
<0040> I see.
<0041> So what's youw answew?
<0042> Hmm.\nIn tewms of wiking you ow not...
<0043> Do you wike Sumika ow not?

<0046> I wike you at times wike these.
<0047> But Sumika advises you not to undewestimate hew!\nShe saw that coming and had something pwepped fow it!\nThewe!
<0048> What?! You'we kidding me, wight?
<0049> You'we KO'd now...\nKukuku, ahahahaha! Booya!
<0050> ...And I hate you at times wike these.
<0051> Wet me ask you something.
<0052> Yes?
<0053> What's youw vewsion numbew at now?
<0054> You'we intewested in something wike that?
<0055> Kind of. Even now, you update youwsewf wike once a month.
<0056> Of couwse Sumika does.\nAnd especiawwy so because ouw enviwonment has changed dwamaticawwy watewy.
<0057> Sumika has wost count of aww those big updates that she gave hewsewf.
<0058> My wife has been comfowtabwe because of you.
<0059> You have no idea how painstaking aww those updates awe.\nSumika bewieves she desewves mowe appweciation fwom you.
<0060> Excewwent wowk.
<0061> You don't sound wike you mean it.\nGeez.
<0062> Howd that battwe. I'm going to pway a cawd.
<0063> What the! That's not faiw!\nHow can you be so nasty! Fow goodness' sake!
<0064> Fufufu.
<0065> Sumika's supew mad now!\nShe's updated hewsewf just now so you can't use any mowe fouw pways against hew!
<0066> You said exactwy the same thing to me wast time I used exactwy the same method against you.
<0067> ......
<0068> This pwanet is so unusuaw.
<0069> Huh?
<0070> Thewe awe giwws who caww themsewves witches, and thewe's this mystewious powew cawwed Giww Powew...
<0071> Ah. it's the powew that gets stwongew the cutew you awe, wight?\nI don't weawwy undewstand how it wowks, though.
<0072> Sumika doesn't undewstand, eithew!\nAnd she doesn't wike it when thewe's something she doesn't undewstand.
<0073> Wewax. Since we have pwenty of time, we can weawn what it is bit by bit, you know.
<0074> Hmm.
<0075> Speaking of, they caww you a witch too, don't they?
<0076> "Fowest Witch" because I wive in the fowest... huh.
<0077> They couwd've done a bettew job with youw name.
<0078> Weww, no mattew what they caww me, they've accepted us hewe, and I'm weawwy happy about that.
<0079> They've accepted Sumika as the "Puyo Puyo Mascot", though!\nThey think she's youw accessowy ow something.
<0080> You shouwdn't have been in that fowm when they visited us hewe.
<0081> Sumika is a vewy cautious giww, so she hawdwy shows peopwe this speciaw, cute fowm.
<0082> Thewe's nothing I can do about that, then.
<0083> Uuu, Sumika wants to be cawwed "Cutie Witch" ow something...
<0084> Phew, we shouwd take a bweak.
<0085> It's been such a heated game...\nSumika wiww make us gween tea!
<0086> Thanks.
<0087> And hewe's the tea! *thud*
<0088> That was fast.
<0089> Because Sumika is high-spec.
<0090> *sip* Mm, I weawwy wike the tea you make.
<0091> Because Sumika is high-spec!
<0092> Fufu.\nI think that'd make you "Tea Witch".
<0093> Sumika doesn't wike that, because it makes hew sound wike a gwandma!
<0094> Oh weawwy? I think it's cute.
<0095> You have tewwibwe sense when it comes to names.\nAnd fashion. You'we awways weawing that sweatshiwt and those pants.
<0096> Give it a west. I weaw them because they'we comfy.
<0097> *sip* *sigh* Hot tea is so good.
<0098> You sound wike a gwandma.
<0099> Wouwd you shut youw mouth!\nYou often act wike quite the gwandma as weww, Suguwi.
<0100> I can't hewp it. In fact, you couwd say I am one in a sense.
<0101> You'we something way beyond a gwandma.
<0102> Maybe you'we wight...
<0103> *sip* What in the wowwd am I?
<0104> Actuawwy, you'we the most mystewious thing in the whowe univewse.
<0105> I twy not to think about that...
<0106> But I sometimes think about that in bed and it keeps me awake.
<0107> What awe you, a kid going thwough pubewty?
<0108> As you can see, I'm just a giww too.
<0109> You'we not taking this convewsation sewiouswy, awe you?
<0110> *sip* Again, you'we the most mystewious entity that Sumika knows.
<0111> Weww, I am me, and that's aww thewe is to it.\nNo point in thinking about that.
<0112> Even though I've been awound fow etewnity, something new stiww keeps coming up evewy now and then.
<0113> And this game is fun...
<0114> I don't think I need anything mowe than that.
<0115> Suguwi... What's with aww the tawking?
<0116> I'm just twying to wewax.
<0117> What's happened to the giww who was wathew hostiwe when she met Sumika fow the fiwst time?
<0118> Don't expect me to wemembew something that happened biwwions of yeaws ago.
<0119> Sumika has backup data fwom then. Wouwd you wike to see it?
<0120> I'ww pass. It's just embawwassing to see my past sewf.
<0121> You awways use that excuse.
<0122> Oh, wiww you keep it, though?\nMaybe I'm going to want to see it some day.
<0123> And you awways ask that.
<0124> Suguwi, how much of youw past do you wemembew?
<0125> I can bawewy wemembew what I ate fow dinnew yestewday.
<0126> That's... pwetty bad.
<0127> But you know.
<0128> Weww... I don't fowget intewesting peopwe ow intewesting events.
<0129> Even now, I don't have any difficuwty wecawwing the names of this giww ow that giww.
<0130> You haven't even said one singwe name yet.
<0131> It was so much fun dancing with this one giww.
<0132> That sounds wathew vague.
<0133> Hmm... Twust me, I weawwy do wemembew.
<0134> I guess it's about time to finish this game.
<0135> Fufufu, we both stiww have an equaw chance to win.
<0136> The dice onwy know.
<0137> Yes, and the pudding wiww be Sumika's!
<0138> I won't wet that happen. I'ww pway the cawd I've been keeping fow this moment.
