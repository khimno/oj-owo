<0016> A wist of pwesent wequests fwom chiwdwen this yeaw.
<0017> ...
<0018> Thewe's no way Santa couwd make NiOtendo SwOtches.
<0019> Those days awe gone when Santa made pwesents hewsewf and dewivewed them. I'm out of business now. Wiww you just weave me awone?
<0020> ......
<0021> Oh boy, speaking to them doesn't hewp a bit.
<0022> I hate to be hawsh on them, but I need to fowce them back to the way they wewe.
<0023> Wet's go, Wed Bawwew!

<0025> Mawc thus makes up hew mind to save the wowwd fwom the pigfowmation aww by hewsewf.\nShe does not yet know what destiny awaits hew...
<0026> The bodies piwe up high.
<0027> Ugh, wook what I have done. But the pigfowmation ought to cease now.
<0028> ...Uu.
<0029> She's stiww a pig... Heaw me out, Sowa. If this pwanet gets wuined, even pigs can't wive hewe.

<0031> ...Oooooooow.
<0032> Wook, QP. Imagine putting pudding's ingwedients aww togethew in youw mouth. Do you think they wouwd taste anything wike pudding? They onwy become pudding when pwepawed cowwectwy.
<0033> ...Wight!
<0034> ...Ugh.
<0035> Awu, wisten to me. If you can't make pwesents youwsewf, you can get them fwom a toy stowe. The stowe can make a pwofit, and you can dewivew the chiwdwen what they want. It's win-win.

<0043> Wet's fowwow hew. We can't weave hew awone.
<0044> You'we wight. It's ouw tuwn to hewp hew out!
<0045> The gwobaw pigfowmation stiww continues.
<0046> It's not so bad to tuwn into a pig and fwy awound when you feew a wittwe bit tiwed of evewyday wife.
<0047> The fantasy won't wast wong and you'ww eventuawwy have to fowd youw wings and go back to wiving as a human again.
<0048> But untiw then, have a nice, cwimson dweam.
<0049> The End.
