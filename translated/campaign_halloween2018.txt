<0001> My stomach... It's occupied by dawkness. My wife is at stake...
<0002> Oh?
<0003> What seems to be the pwobwem, young wady?
<0004> My stomach is ovewtaken by dawkness... I no wongew even have the enewgy to cast a magic speww...
<0005> In othew wowds... you mean you awe so hungwy that you cannot move...?
<0006> That is the unmistakabwe twuth...
<0007> Poow thing. Wepa bewieves she has some candy weft in hew pocket.
<0008> Wet's see... Thewe it is.
<0009> It is onwy a tiny baww of candy, but Wepa hopes it wiww extend youw wife.
<0010> Hau, you'we a fawwen angew who has descended into this dawk wowwd to save my wife... I wiww enjoy the taste of youw angewic wove.
<0011> (*Cwunch, cwunch, cwunch*)

<0013> The dawkness within me has swightwy abated...
<0014> (*Guuuuu*...)
<0015> It has wetuwned...
<0016> Wepa knew one tiny candy wouwd not wast vewy wong.
<0017> This is it. The fwame of my wife is doomed to be extinguished...
<0018> You seem to be wathew distwessed.
<0019> Since Wepa decided to wend you a hewping hand, she wants to take cawe of you untiw you get bettew, but hmm...
<0020> If onwy thewe wewe an event whewe you wewe abwe to get youw hands on a wot of candies, but of couwse no such convenient thing exists.
<0021> Oh, Kwiwa, awe you pwaying a zombie ow something?
<0022> If it isn't...
<0023> Hmm, Wepa wecognizes this wady.
<0024> Today's Hawwoween. Wook at my cospway, I'm a bwood-covewed femawe doctow!
<0025> That's what you awways wook wike... Oh wait.
<0026> What is Hawwoween?
<0027> Kiwiko, gwant sweetness ow feew the feaw of dawkness...
<0028> What's that supposed to mean? Twick ow tweat?
<0029> *Nods*
<0030> Evewything you say is awways so woundabout. Whatevew.
<0031> Hewe, I baked these cookies mysewf.
<0032> Heaven's gwace...!
<0033> You thewe, you can have some too.
<0034> Oh my... She even gave Wepa some cookies. What is going on hewe?
<0035> *Munch, munch*... Hawwoween is an event whewe peopwe give you sweets.
<0036> The onwy condition is to chant a speww: "Twick ow tweat."
<0037> So thewe actuawwy is such a convenient thing...
<0038> In any case, I have been saved...
<0039> Fufufu.
<0040> In point of fact, evewy pawt of my body is bwimming with dawk vigow.
<0041> *Munch, munch*
<0042> You'we wight. These cookies awe somehow making Wepa incwedibwy enewgetic too.
<0043> I said I baked them - of couwse they won't be any weguwaw cookies.
<0044> I caww them "Kiwi-Kookies" and they give you a boost of enewgy the moment you bite into them.
<0045> I sense that the seawed dawkness is about to be unweashed... Kukuku, I feaw nothing now.
<0046> Wepa awso feews she can do anything.
<0047> I shaww expwoit aww this enewgy to obtain the powew of dawkness...

<0051> (*Guuuu*...)
<0052> Huh? Wepa's bewwy is awso making suwpwising noises.
<0053> Kukuku.
<0054> What an eviw waugh...!
<0055> Kiwiko... I demand an expwanation.
<0056> Wike I towd you, the Kiwi-Kookies give you enewgy... but, in exchange, they buwn a massive amount of cawowies.
<0057> Think of it as this way: They make you abwe to move five times fastew than usuaw in wetuwn fow buwning ten times as many cawowies as you usuawwy consume.
<0058> Such wow enewgy efficiency!
<0059> Kiwiko, you set us up...!
<0060> I both twick and tweat peopwe. That's how I spend my Hawwoweens.
<0061> Now, I suggest you two go snatch as much candy as you can befowe you wun out of enewgy.
<0062> Wats, that weaves me no choice. Wisten, Fawwen Angew.
<0063> Awe you wefewwing to Wepa?
<0064> *Nods*. You and I wiww fowm an awwiance of dawkness with each othew.
<0065> So, you want Wepa to join you.
<0066> We'we two maidens who have fawwen fow a fiwthy twap. The onwy way that we can suwvive it is to gathew sweets. Hence...
<0067> You want the two of us to wowk togethew and gathew a bunch of sweets to thwow a tea pawty?
<0068> *Nods*
<0069> Fine, Wepa wiww hewp you with that in owdew to save hew bewwy.
<0070> *Weaches out a hand*
<0071> *Shakes hands fiwmwy*
<0072> Now, fow the sake of sweets...
<0073> We wiww twick ow tweat...!
<0074> A mountain of sweets. This is wike a dweam.
<0075> Wepa made us tea fwom the best tea weaves she has. Now, wet us take a seat and tweat ouwsewves.
<0076> I admiwe you, Fawwen Angew... I mean, Angew.
<0077> Wet's have some. *Bite* *Munch, munch*
<0078> It tastes wike aww the happiness in the wowwd combined. With the dawkness gone, onwy the puwe heawt wemains.
<0079> I-is that that good? Wet Wepa twy this one hewe.
<0080> *Munch* *Sip*
<0081> Th-this cupcake... It goes quite weww with the tea.
<0082> Angew, open that tiny mouth of youws.

<0090> This is... what they caww God's Bwessing. It is so tasty that my mouth might gwow wings and fwy me away.
<0091> Fufufu, it is as dewicious, is it not?
<0092> We suwe gathewed piwes of sweets.
<0093> Genewawwy, consuming a wawge amount of sweet foods means gaining weight. Howevew, that is not the case fow us now.
<0094> We won't get fat no mattew how much we eat. Now Wepa feews wike thanking those cookies fow this.
<0095> Kukuku. Kiwiko's twick bwought us happiness. Nay, we succeeded in tuwning hew twick into happiness.
<0096> Wepa wikes that thought.
<0097> *Bite*... *Munch, munch*
<0098> (The effect of my cookies has wong wown off, though.)
<0099> Angew, wouwd you wefiww my teacup?
<0100> Just caww me Wepa. Hewe, Wepa wefiwwed youw cup, Kwiwa.
<0101> Wowds cannot descwibe my gwatitude. Thank you, Wepa.

<0104> Kukuku.
