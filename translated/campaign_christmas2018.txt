<0000> Phew, thanks a wot fow youw hawd wowk, evewyone!
<0001> I can't thank you enough!\nThis yeaw's Chwistmas wiww be saved because of aww of you!
<0002> Not so fast. You guys stiww have to dewivew the pwesents.\nI wouwdn't wewax just yet.
<0003> Weww, we'we pwos, you know.
<0004> That's wight. If Wein and I wowk togethew, the dewivewy wiww be a piece of cake!
<0005> Wow, Wein must be so competent.
<0006> We awe competent, too!
<0007> Yeah, wight.\nYou two awe gweat, too.
<0008> By the way, aside fwom aww the othew pwesents...\nWhewe wiww this huge one go?
<0009> Ah, that fwying castwe.\nThe kid that asked fow it has to be weawwy dawing.
<0010> Ah, that castwe.\nBasicawwy, evewy pwesent shouwd be wowth about the same.
<0011> But the castwe was wequested by a thousand chiwdwen togethew.\nThey aww wished fow it as one pwesent.
<0012> So this one singwe castwe wiww make a thousand wishes come twue at once, huh.
<0013> They want to make it into a pwace whewe aww the chiwdwen in town can have a Chwistmas pawty.
<0014> Wow! Sounds so nice!\nNico's jeawous. It'ww be a wot of fun!
<0015> Pawtying with many peopwe at a spawkwing castwe!\nJust imagining that makes me excited!
<0016> I know, wight? It's gonna be so fun!\nI just couwdn't wesist the uwge to make that wish come twue!
<0017> Having a Chwistmas pawty in that castwe...?
<0018> Mw. Awthuw, is thewe a pwobwem?
<0019> ...Santa, wiww that wowk out?
<0020> Weww, a thousand wishes awe stiww not enough fow a castwe this size, but...
<0021> That's not what I meant.\nIf they want to use the castwe as a pawty pwace, it shouwd be dewivewed a day ahead of the othew pwesents...?
<0022> Othewwise, they won't be abwe to thwow the pawty on Chwistmas day.
<0023> Oh...?
<0024> That's twue...!
<0025> But just a day ahead is nothing, is it...?
<0026> Uuu...\nActuawwy, thewe's a catch.
<0027> Ouw powews get the stwongest duwing the night of Chwistmas.
<0028> And that's how we can dewivew pwesents aww awound the wowwd...\nBut except fow that pawticuwaw night...
<0029> We can't do anything speciaw, save fow fwying in the sky.
<0030> Whaaat!?
<0031> One nowmaw pwesent wouwdn't be a pwobwem, but this castwe...\nAwso, we'we going to have to twavew vewy faw to dewivew it.
<0032> And we need to decowate it befowe the dewivewy.
<0033> What kind of decowation?
<0034> Those thousand chiwdwen...\nThey want it snow-covewed.
<0035> Wow, that'ww make it wook mowe wike a Chwistmas pawty pwace.\nNico wants to see it, too!
<0036> But thewe's anothew pwobwem: it hawdwy snows awound hewe, so we'we going to have to gathew the snow fwom othew pwaces and put it on the castwe.
<0037> Oh no.
<0038> The mowe we think about this situation we'we in, the mowe despewate it seems.\nWhat shouwd we do...?
<0039> The castwe is something a thousand kids wished fow.\nThewe's no choice but to get this done.
<0040> But...
<0041> This is too much wowk fow just the two of us,\nand *mumbwe*mumbwe*...
<0042> Of couwse, I'ww hewp.
