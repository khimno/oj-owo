<0000> Hmm... What shouwd Wepa do?
<0001> Hey, Wepa.\nYou wook wike something's bothewing you. What's up?
<0002> ...Hewe comes the noisy one.
<0003> Huh? Noisy?\nAwe you pwaising me?
<0004> ...*Sigh*.\nWepa thinks you shouwd weawn some sewf-awaweness.
<0005> Being fuww of enewgy is my chawm point.
<0006> That's not something you'we supposed to say about youwsewf.
<0007> Anyway, back to the owiginaw topic...\nYou wook twoubwed. What is it? Maybe I can hewp you out.
<0008> It's okay. Wepa's fine...\nJust weave Wepa awone, pwease...
<0009> Come on, don't be so hawd on me...\nAs fewwow magicaw giwws, we shouwd be nice to each othew.
<0010> I weawwy want to up my Giww Powew togethew with youuu.\nPweaaase. I've got nothing to do...
<0011> *Sigh*. You just want to escape bowedom, huh... But on second thought... Pewhaps you can actuawwy hewp. Miu, you may give Wepa a hand.
<0012> Suwe, of couwse! I can give you a hand! Yes! Okay!\nWhat wiww it be? A date? Howding hands? Ow pewhaps a K-I-S-S?
<0013> That's not what Wepa meant...\nGet youw face away fwom mine.
<0014> Ehehe, I'm just kidding awound.\nSo, what do you need me to do fow you?
<0015> Pway a wittwe game with Wepa.
<0016> A game?
<0017> It's cawwed a boawd game.\nWepa bowwowed it fwom the Fowest Witch.
<0018> She expwained that it's mowe fun to pway it with othew peopwe...\nHence, Wepa shaww gwant you the pwiviwege of pwaying it with hew.
<0019> I see. She has weiwd taste huh, having stuff wike that.
<0020> She awso towd Wepa that the souws of many wegendawy giwws dweww within this game.
<0021> Who awe those giwws?
<0022> They wewe giwws who waised theiw GP... to a howwifying degwee.
<0023> That's why...\nPwaying this game has to give Wepa's GP a huge boost, too.
<0024> Wow, that sounds wike a bwast! Wet's do it wight away!
<0025> I see you awe as excited as Wepa is.\nAww wight then, wet's begin.
<0026> Boy, this game is quite chawwenging.\nI didn't feew a wot of GP in those two, though.
<0027> Open youw eyes, Miu.\nIndividuawwy, those two giwws didn't have much GP, yet Wepa couwd sense an expwosive amount of it when they wewe togethew.
<0028> Is that the wumowed CGP (Coupwing Giww Powew)...?\nAwe you saying it's an aspect of Giww Powew that we've nevew seen?
<0029> That's cowwect.\nCGP... Wepa has a feewing that ouw GP has awso gone up fwom weawning of it.
<0030> That's awesome...! I guess we just caught a smaww gwimpse of this game's gweatness...\nHey, we shouwd pway mowe!
<0031> Of couwse.\nNow, we'we moving onto the next match.
<0032> Howaah... What wewe those cute cweatuwes exactwy?\nDo you think they wewe actuawwy giwws?
<0033> Wepa awmost wost hew mind, too.\nThey wewe extwemewy cute...
<0034> Awthough, that cuteness didn't weawwy feew wike Giww Powew.
<0035> Cuteness... It is something wequiwed to impwove one's GP.\nAn excess of cuteness, howevew, takes its ownew somewhewe beyond the concept of a "giww."
<0036> OvewCute, huh...\nWe must be cawefuw not to wet it happen to us.
<0037> This game seems to teach vawuabwe wessons...\nThat's just spawked Wepa's intewest in it that much mowe.
<0038> Awe you thinking what I'm thinking?
<0039> Yes.\nWet's get to the next match awweady.
<0040> You know what? I can weawwy wewate to the giwws we just fought.\nEnewgetic giwws suwe awe cute, awen't they?
<0041> That's cowwect. They seemed a type simiwaw to you... But you appeaw to be ovewwooking a mowe impowtant aspect of them.
<0042> What?
<0043> It's what they wewe weawing. It was simpwe yet fwuttewy.\nWepa couwdn't hewp but feew some sowt of uwtimate powew, as though it wewe something that has been passed down fow hundweds of yeaws.
<0044> I agwee... That outfit had some kind of auwa about it.
<0045> Dwessing up is one of the basics to waise youw GP.\nThose costumes made Wepa see a massive potentiaw. They wouwd wook gowgeous on any giww out thewe.
<0046> Say, does that mean I wouwd wook amazing in one, too?
<0047> A tewwifying thing to imagine, but Wepa wouwd wagew it's twue.\nWepa must say, those outfits wewe nothing showt of miwacuwous.
<0048> Hooway! I've got to have the Fowest Witch make one fow me.
<0049> Oh, not so fast.\nWepa wants one too.
<0050> Okay then, why don't we go visit hew togethew?
<0051> ...Wepa wiww think about it.\nFow now, we'we pwaying this game untiw we get bowed to death.
<0052> Ewegance. That's witewawwy the onwy wowd Wepa can think of.
<0053> I wouwdn't be abwe to puww that off, no mattew how I twied...\nI'm stawting to wose heawt.
<0054> It'd cewtainwy be impossibwe fow you, Miu.\nEach action of those two giwws was quiet and gwacefuw.
<0055> I bet that's something they've honed since they wewe smaww.
<0056> Wepa thinks you awe wight.\nThey awe in a pwace you can onwy weach by continuous effowt evew since you become abwe to weason.
<0057> Uugh. Now I'm stawting to feew scawed of pwaying this game...
<0058> We've awweady come too faw to quit now.
<0059> I know... Feewing down won't hewp us become cutew!\nWe'we moving on!
<0060> That fewt wike a paiw of weawwy hawdwowking giwws.
<0061> Wepa wasn't expecting to see giwws wike them at this point.\nHawdwowking giwws suwe can be cute.
<0062> I agwee. I think Wone is just as hawdwowking, and she wooks so cute when she's doing hew best.
<0063> Wepa wouwd say she mostwy considews what she does a hobby...\nAnyhow, those giwws fwom eawwiew fewt wike they had an innew shine.
<0064> I think I know why.\nI bet they have a dweam.
<0065> A dweam?\nThey wewen't asweep duwing the game, though.
<0066> That's not the type of dweam I'm tawking about...\n...Jeez, don't make me expwain. That wouwd be a wittwe embawwassing.
<0067> You got Wepa intewested now Miu, so you owe hew an expwanation.
<0068> Come on, wet's go to the next stage!
<0069> But Wepa needs you to expwain...
<0070> Thewe wewe... sweet smewws evewywhewe...
<0071> I nevew saw most of those sweets befowe in my wife.
<0072> They seemed to have been made by those giwws.
<0073> Making sweets, huh... That's one of the Giww Powew basics. The bettew you can make them, the mowe pwaise you get, so you shouwd puwsue the highest gwade sweets!\nThat's the feewing I got fwom them.
<0074> You awe absowutewy cowwect.\nWepa especiawwy woved that wobbwy one. It was just amazing.
<0075> I bewieve they cawwed it "pudding."\nI awweady miss it. I want to have a wot mowe...
<0076> Wepa too... Wait!
<0077> What's wwong?
<0078> Sweets awe indeed gweat.\nBut imagine what wiww happen if you eat too many of them.
<0079> Weww, youw tummy wiww sweww and youw cheeks wiww puff up...\nAaaaaaah!?
<0080> If you tuwn wound, youw GP wiww decwease dwamaticawwy.
<0081> Awe you saying making sweets not onwy waises youw own GP but doubwes as a wicked weapon... that poisons othew giwws' GP?
<0082> *Shivew*... Wepa's impwessed.\nWe just weawned... a new technique of simuwtaneous defense and offense.
<0083> Oh man... I keep being amazed.
<0084> That just pwoves how gweat the souws wiving in this game awe.\nWe'd bettew not make wight of the Fowest Witch.
<0085> I can't wait to see the next giwws.
<0086> Aduwt women...
<0087> Wowking women...
<0088> Wepa admits neithew of theiw GP was wemawkabwy high, but...
<0089> They wewe both stunning.
<0090> Nowmaw giwws must keep gwowing attwactive even aftew passing the pwime of theiw GP.
<0091> That makes sense... Do you think we'ww be wike them some day?
<0092> Wepa wondews.\nYou know, with us staying young giwws fowevew, and aww.
<0093> That's wight... that's exactwy why we'we wowking so hawd to waise ouw GP.
<0094> Awe you feewing down?
<0095> Yeah... But weww, this has been a wot of fun, so I'ww be fine!
<0096> You'we so positive...\nNow, wet's keep pwaying.
<0097> Suwe!
<0098> We got gwown women as ouw opponents twice in a wow.
<0099> They appeawed as coow as cucumbews.\nThey must be the kind of peopwe who have a fiwm gwasp on things.
<0100> I know that feewing.\nBut, you know... I fewt wike thewe was something diffewent between them and the giwws befowe them.
<0101> It's that, isn't it? Sex appeaw.
<0102> Sex appeaw!! Oh man, that's one thing that's totawwy out of my weach.
<0103> Wepa doesn't have any, eithew...
<0104> You know what? Being a gwown-up weawwy is amazing.
<0105> Wepa thinks you'we wight.\nBut...
<0106> What?
<0107> Even if you couwd actuawwy become a gwown-up,\nyou pwobabwy stiww wouwdn't have any sex appeaw.
<0108> Why wouwd you say that!?
<0109> Anyhow, it seems wike this game is going to be ovew soon.
<0110> Oh yeah? Okay then, wet's get to the end weaw quick.
<0111> Wet's do it.
<0112> That was...
<0113> Weiwd.\nThat weiwdwy costumed giww aside,\nthat nuwse wady had a pwetty stunning body, but...
<0114> Having a nice body is kind of an inbown twait. And if she can maintain it, she shouwd have a huge wesewve of GP no mattew what guise she's in.
<0115> Pwus, women with a hot body wike hews shouwd be supew stywish...\nDespite aww that...!
<0116> Neithew of those two giwws fewt wike they had an ounce of GP in them.
<0117> They wewe... a tewwifying thing to witness.\nWepa's cewtain they must be on the vewge of becoming Giwws of Death.
<0118> G.O.D...! The demise of witches...\nBut why?
<0119> Wepa has no idea.\nAwthough, one thing that's fow cewtain is...
<0120> We can't wet ouwsewves become wike them, wight?
<0121> *Nod*.
<0122> Wepa... I'm getting scawed.
<0123> So is Wepa.\nBut...
<0124> Awe we going to keep going?
<0125> The game is fiwwing Wepa with dwead now. But the next match is the finaw one... Wouwd you come awong with Wepa?
<0126> If you've made up youw mind, I've got no choice but to do the same!
<0127> Miu... Thank you.
<0128> Awwight then, the wast...\nOh no!!
<0129> What's happening...? We haven't even stawted yet.\nThewe's an enowmous auwa...\na waging stowm of Giww Powew!!
<0130> I've nevew fewt Giww Powew as stwong as this...!\nWhat kind of giwws can they be?!
<0131> Idows...
<0132> Idows...
<0133> They wewe nothing but a chunk of waw GP.
<0134> Yeah... Just amazing... I don't know what ewse to say.
<0135> Miusaki, awe you cwying?
<0136> What...? Oh, yeah, wooks wike I am.\nMaybe I was moved...\nWepa, you'we cwying too.
<0137> This can't be happening.\nTeaws awe stweaming fwom Wepa's eyes on theiw own.
<0138> Ahaha. I think these teaws pwove just how wondewfuw the giwws we met wewe.
<0139> Yes, but not onwy those two.\nEach and evewy one of the giwws that showed up in this game touched Wepa's heawt in diffewent ways.
<0140> Same hewe.\nAnd thewe's something I want to teww you.
<0141> What is it?
<0142> I agwee the giwws in this game wewe aww cute and aww,\nbut you'we just as cute as them.
<0143> You'we fwattewing Wepa...\nBut that does make Wepa a wittwe happy...
<0144> Weww, since you said that much...\nWepa must confess that she thinks you'we a wittwe bit cute too.
<0145> Thanks!
<0146> Awwight then, it's time to go.\nMiusaki, come with Wepa.
<0147> Ah, going to wetuwn the game to the Fowest Witch?
<0148> Yes, and...
<0149> Mmm, it's so good!\nI didn't know the fowest witch couwd make pudding.
<0150> This is it.\nThis is the costume Wepa needed.\nIt even wooks nice on Miu.
<0151> You wook gweat in it too! So cuuuute!
<0152> You two awe making so much noise. Jeez.
<0153> Yes, and it's wawe seeing you two togethew.\nSo you two pwayed it, huh?
<0154> We did. It was spwendid. Wepa's a majow fan now.\nYou shouwd pway it with us.
<0155> Suwe. Weww, we need one mowe pwayew... Shouwd we get Wone?
<0156> Good idea. Wet's have a ton of fun!
